      rename the folder: 1718
      https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset/code (2020-2023 youtube trending data)
      rename the folder: 2023
    - Make sure all required data files are in the specified directories '/Users/<USERID>/Desktop/Data' and do not forget to change <USERID> as your own userID in all code.
    - Clone the repository using: `git clone git@github.sfu.ca:zla285/CJMY.git`
    - Install JupyterLab with pip: `pip install jupyterlab`
      Once installed, launch JupyterLab with: `jupyter lab`

3. **Additional Notes:**
    - All files related to implementing the project can be found under main branch.
    - The entire project has been implemented in Python.
    - In the first stage, we conducted a question-by-question analysis of the 2017-2018 data. 
    - In the second stage, we selected valuable questions, analyzed the data from 2020-2023, and compared them with the analysis results from 2017-2018.
    - In the third stage, we used machine learning to predict the relationship between views and trends.
